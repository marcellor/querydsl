Querydsl JPA Example is an example project that demonstrates some best practices on how to use Querydsl JPA in repositories.

Querydsl combines the typesafety of a Criteria API with the syntax of JPQL into an attractive alternative.

Guice is used as the DI layer to complement the already available Spring + Querydsl tutorials and examples.
